This is an thing written in [elm](https://elm-lang.org/) where you push a button and it rolls some dice. ðŸŽ²

I put it on a computer connected to the internet so you can use it at [dice.froghat.ca](https://dice.froghat.ca/) maybe if that link works.

Here's a picture of what it probably looks like.

The project's public git repo is on source hut at [git.sr.ht/~sqwishy/super-dicey-die-roller](https://git.sr.ht/~sqwishy/super-dicey-die-roller). You can find the source code there.

Also, you can roll [Fate](https://fate-srd.com/) dice too.

## Contributing

Good luck. Since I put this on sr.ht, contributions are supposed to be sent to something like a mailing list. But I don't have a mailing list for this project because I didn't want to make one for just myself. So you could send an email to me or something. Maybe tell me to make a mailling list or just that it's all going to be okay and stuff or whatever.

Or there might be a mirror on GitHub with issue tracking.
